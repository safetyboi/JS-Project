BACKGROUND:
    This is a game about picking up trash (and throwing it away properly)

FUNCTIONALITY & MVP'S:
    In Trashpicker, users will be able to:
        -practice correctly identifying the proper disposal method for various kinds of waste
        -hover over a specific trash icon (soiled cardboard to-go container, battery, plastic wrap, etc.) to generate four buttons corresponding to the four disposal methods this game will test knowledge of: regular waste (black), recyclable (blue), compostable (green), and special (yellow).
        -recieve feedback upon clicking any of these buttons ("You got it!", "Almost...") as well as a pop-up explanation of why that particular piece of trash needs to be disposed of the way it does. Educational!
        -select a button entitled "I'm Ready to Play" to leave this practice area and enter "game mode"
        -From within game mode, navigate an avatar around a bird's-eye view park landscape littered with trash that corresponds tp the examples from the practice area.
        -"Grab" the trash by holding down the appropriate key.
        -"Throw away" the trash by releasing the same key, once they are within the hit-box of the correct trash can (four in total, corresponding to the buttons from the practice area)
        -receive feedback once all trash has been sorted and the level is over about whether they sorted every piece correctly, and some context about what happens in the real world when trash ends up in the wrong bin.

IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:

    -FRIDAY: Get trash units to spawn in random locations on a square map, for game-mode. Get grid of boxes to display properly, for practice area. Get hover effect for buttons to appear below each box.
    -SATURDAY: Get avatar moving around square map. Make it so that, when user holds down the correct button, the trash "moves" whenever their avatar moves.
    -SUNDAY: Write blurbs for each of the practice area's trash types. Make it so that the user receives different message based on whether they chose correctly. Make it so that when they click the "I'm ready to Play" button, they shift into game-mode.
    -MONDAY: Make the avatar look like a person holding a trashpicker. Make the disposal bins in game-mode look like disposal bins.
    -TUESDAY: Make trash pretty + introduce 6-9 different kinds of trash, with accompanying "look".
    -WEDNESDAY: Make it so that users can toggle between game mode and practice area. Make the text + location of the "I'm ready to play" button change to say "I need more practice!" at the top of the screen, when players are in game mode. Create the visual effect of "sliding" up / down the screen when entering/exiting either mode.
