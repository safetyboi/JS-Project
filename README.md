# JS-Project

BACKGROUND:
    This is a game about picking up trash (and throwing it away properly)

FUNCTIONALITY & MVP'S:
    In Trashpicker, users will be able to:
        -practice correctly identifying the proper disposal method for various kinds of waste.
        -hover over a specific trash icon (soiled cardboard to-go container, battery, plastic wrap, etc.) 
        -select a button entitled "I'm Ready to Play" to leave this practice area and enter "game mode"
        -From within game mode, navigate an avatar around a bird's-eye view park landscape littered with trash that corresponds tp the examples from the practice area.
        -"Grab" the trash by holding down the appropriate key.
        -"Throw away" the trash by releasing the same key, once they are within the hit-box of the correct trash can (four in total)
        -receive feedback once all trash has been sorted and the level is over about whether they sorted every piece correctly.
