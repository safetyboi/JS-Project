1. Q: How do I ensure that squares don't spawn partially off the map, or partially overlaying each other?
    A: create unique non-overlapping "strips" (defined as x/y ranges) for each trash-piece and enforce these constraints at the time of spawning.
2. How do I make certain parts of the map untraversable / invalid for spawning trash objects?
3. Lag when changing directional keys
